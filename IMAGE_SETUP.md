# Wigloo Image Setup - COMPLETED ✅

## Wigloo Listening Image Integration

The voice chat UI has been successfully updated to use the Wigloo character image.

### Current Implementation:

✅ **Image imported** from `src/assets/images/wigloo-image.png`
✅ **Component updated** to use the imported image
✅ **Fallback system** in place for error handling
✅ **Mobile full-screen layout** (no gaps)
✅ **Animated listening visualization** with rings and glow effects
✅ **Safe area support** for notched devices

### How it works:

- The `WinglooIllustration` component imports and uses `wigloo-image.png`
- Image is displayed in a 200x200px circular container
- Animated listening rings appear when `isListening` is true
- Background glow effects pulse during listening state
- Fallback CSS illustration shows if image fails to load

### File Structure:
```

  assets/
    images/

### Status: COMPLETE ✅

The voice chat UI is now fully functional with:
- Wigloo character image integration
- Full mobile screen coverage
- Proper animations and state management
- Figma design compliance
